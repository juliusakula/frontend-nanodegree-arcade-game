Arrow Keys to move. Avoid bugs. In case of emergency `A` & `D` throw tomatoes, which kill bugs.

Created from a fork of [bahalps's fork](http://bahalps.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/) of the [Udacity Frogger game](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game). His version had several of the enemy types you see. I took his version and broke it up into many files to make it more maintainable. It is easier to find the code you are looking for, if its in its own file. Grunt is used to combine all the files into one app.js, and also minifies the app.js file to reduce HTTP request size.

Students should use this rubric: https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud015/l-3072058665/m-3072588797

for self-checking their submission.
